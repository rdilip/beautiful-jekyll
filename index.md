title: Physics Olympiad Tutoring
subtitle: The What, the Why, and the How
---

I competed in the United States Physics Olympiad throughout high school, winning a silver medal my junior year and a gold medal my senior year. I've generally tutor 2-3 students per year. If you're interested in preparation for the USAPhO, please get in touch at rdilip1137(at)gmail.com. Here are a few notes.

- If you're confident in qualifying to camp and want IPhO prep, I would advise you to look elsewhere. Having never competed in IPhO or attended camp, I don't have a very good perspective.
- By far my best students are those who are interested and willing to push themselves outside of class. Put very tersely: if you want to succeed, you will need to put in some hard work outside of our time together [^1].
- If you're interested in working with me, please send me an email at rdilip1137(at)gmail.com, and make note of what you want coaching for (USAPhO? F=ma? Both? AP Physics?)

[^1]: Longer version: our time together is a multiplier of your efforts. As a tutor, I can hopefully direct your energies to important topics, explain particularly challenging topics that you would have eventually gotten on your own, but would have been difficult, and give you some general heuristics that lead to you doing better on the actual exam. If you aren't putting in much effort outside of our time together, those aren't particularly helpful. To put it much more eloquently, [here's](https://usamo.wordpress.com/2016/02/07/stop-paying-me-per-hour/) a good discussion.
